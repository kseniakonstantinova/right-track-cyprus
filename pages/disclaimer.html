            <h2>1. Educational Purpose Only</h2>
            <p>The content published on this website, including but not limited to blog articles, exercise descriptions, treatment guides, injury information, and rehabilitation protocols, is provided by Right Track Rehabilitation & Performance Centre (<strong>"the Practice"</strong>) strictly for <strong>general educational and informational purposes</strong>.</p>
            <p>This content does not constitute medical advice, physiotherapy advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations for any individual person or condition.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Nothing on this website should be used as a substitute for direct, individualised assessment and treatment by a qualified healthcare professional.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>2. No Practitioner-Patient Relationship</h2>
            <p>Accessing, reading, or interacting with any content on this website — including blog articles, exercise guides, FAQs, and social media posts — <strong>does not establish a practitioner-patient (therapeutic) relationship</strong> between you and any physiotherapist, clinician, or staff member of the Practice.</p>
            <p>A practitioner-patient relationship is only formed through a formal in-person or telehealth consultation that includes an individual clinical assessment, informed consent, and an agreed treatment plan.</p>

            <h2>3. Individual Variation & Risk</h2>
            <p>Health conditions, injuries, and recovery timelines vary significantly between individuals. Information presented in our articles is based on published research and general clinical experience, but <strong>may not be appropriate for your specific situation</strong>.</p>
            <p>Factors that can affect the applicability of general information include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-existing medical conditions or comorbidities</li>
                <li>Previous injuries and surgical history</li>
                <li>Current medications</li>
                <li>Age, fitness level, and activity demands</li>
                <li>Individual anatomical and biomechanical differences</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Exercise & Activity Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Any exercises, stretches, movement protocols, or physical activity recommendations described on this website are <strong>general in nature</strong>. Performing exercises without proper individual assessment carries inherent risk of injury.</p>
            <p><strong>Before beginning any exercise programme described on this website:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consult your physiotherapist, physician, or qualified healthcare provider</li>
                <li>Obtain an individual assessment if you have any existing pain, injury, or medical condition</li>
                <li>Stop immediately and seek professional advice if you experience pain, dizziness, or unusual symptoms during any exercise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You perform any exercises described on this website entirely at your own risk.</p>

            <h2>5. Clinical Evidence & Accuracy</h2>
            <p>We endeavour to reference current, peer-reviewed research and to present evidence-based information. However:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Medical knowledge and clinical guidelines evolve continuously</li>
                <li>Research findings may be superseded by newer evidence</li>
                <li>Clinical recommendations may change as new data becomes available</li>
                <li>We do not guarantee that all information is complete, current, or free of error</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Practice makes reasonable efforts to review and update content periodically, but does not warrant that all published information reflects the most current evidence at the time of reading.</p>

            <h2>6. Professional Qualifications</h2>
