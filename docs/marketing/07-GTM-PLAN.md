## CRITICAL GAPS

### Critical — fix before launching content
| Gap | Status | Action |
|-----|--------|--------|
| **Google Business Profile not verified** | Not done | Verify TODAY. Without it = invisible on Google Maps |
| **Meta Pixel not installed** | No Pixel ID | Create in Meta Business Suite → install on site |
| **LinkedIn Company Page — empty** | No content | Complete: description, logo, cover image, services |
| **No video content at all** | Zero | **Photo/video shoot solves this** |
| **No carousels / infographics** | Zero | Create templates in Canva |
| **No lead magnet PDF** | Promised on site | Create "Sports Injury Prevention Guide" |
| **Formspree endpoint not configured** | Form is dead | Configure real endpoint |

### Important — fix within first 2 weeks
| Gap | Action |
|-----|--------|
| No content templates (Canva) | Create 5-6 branded templates |
| No Instagram highlight covers | Create: Services, Reviews, Team, Cases, FAQ |
| No link-in-bio page | Linktree or alternative with key links |
| No QR code for Google Reviews | Print and display in clinic |
| No UTM tags for tracking | Create UTMs for each channel |

## CHANNEL STRATEGY

### Core principle: One piece of content → 7 formats

Every content unit (shoot, article, case study) gets repurposed:
```
1 video shoot (1-3 min raw)
    → Reel 30-60 sec (Instagram/Facebook/TikTok)
    → YouTube Short
    → LinkedIn native video (with subtitles)
    → 3-5 Stories (clips)
    → Carousel (key frames + text)
    → Blog post (extended version)
    → Google Business post
```

## CAROUSEL GUIDELINES

### Carousel format (Instagram/LinkedIn):
- **Slide 1:** Hook (provocative headline, large text on branded navy/orange background)
- **Slides 2-7:** Content (1 idea per slide, minimal text, photo or illustration)
- **Slide 8 (last):** CTA — "Save this for later" + "Book: righttrackphysio.com.cy"

### Carousel types:
1. **Educational:** "5 knee rehab mistakes" → 1 mistake = 1 slide
2. **Infographic:** "Return-to-sport timeline after ACL" → visual scale
3. **Myth vs Fact:** each slide = one myth, debunked with source
4. **Case study:** before/after, treatment stages, result
5. **Checklist:** "When to see a physio" → slides with checkbox style

### Carousel branding (Canva template):
- Background: Navy (#0A1628) or Off-white (#F8F9FA)
- Accent: Orange (#FF6B35) for headlines and highlights
- Font: Sans-serif (Montserrat or Inter)
- Right Track logo in bottom-right corner
- Antonis's photo on the first or last slide

## ANTONIS BRAND vs RIGHT TRACK BRAND: HOW THEY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER

```
ANTONIS PETRI (personal brand)
├── "The Athlete's Physio"
├── Expert content (Injury Decoded, science, opinions)
├── LinkedIn thought leadership
├── First-person Reels
├── "I work at Right Track" → drives traffic TO the clinic
│
RIGHT TRACK (clinic brand)
├── "Where Athletes Recover"
├── Services, team, results, Pilates
├── Booking / conversion
├── GESY, local marketing
├── Facebook local audience
├── Google Business Profile
```

**Rule:** Antonis = discovery (people find his content) → Right Track = conversion (people book at the clinic). They don't compete — they complement.
