## Critical Gaps (Pre-Implementation)

| Gap | Severity | Impact |
|-----|----------|--------|
| Zero Google visibility — search returns nothing | CRITICAL | Invisible to search traffic |
| No Google Business Profile indexed | CRITICAL | "Physio near me" = invisible |
| No analytics (GA4 not active) | CRITICAL | Flying blind |
| No content marketing (blog/articles) | HIGH | Zero organic search potential |
| No video content | HIGH | Missing #1 trust format for healthcare |
| No email list / newsletter | MEDIUM | No owned audience |
| No Google Reviews visible | CRITICAL | Competitors have reviews, we have zero |

## Competitor Landscape — Nicosia

| Clinic | Positioning | Threat Level |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Alexis Pitsillides | 15+ yrs, board-certified | High — established |
| Kountouriotis Center | Since 1998, serious cases | High — legacy |
| Elinos Petrou | Strovolos (our area!), 7.5/10 rating | High — local overlap |
| Healion Physiotherapy | "Best physio in Cyprus", sports-focused | Medium — similar positioning |
| A-Z Physio Health | Strovolos, MSK + sports | Medium — local overlap |
| Biokinetic | International credentials, home physio | Low — different niche |

**Key finding:** 2 competitors (Elinos Petrou, A-Z Physio) are in Strovolos. They are indexed, reviewed, findable. We were not.

## Strengths to Leverage
1. University affiliation — almost nobody else has this
2. Sports team partnerships — working with real athletes
3. Gym + Clinic combo — rehab-to-performance pipeline
4. Young, hungry team — can be bold with content
5. Strong technical website — better than 90% of Cyprus physio sites

## Weaknesses
1. Zero digital footprint outside the website
2. No personal brand built yet
3. Positioning was generic ("evidence-based" = everyone)
4. Trying to serve everyone at once
