| # | Topic (hook — opening line) | Content Pillar |
|---|---------------------------|--------|
| 1 | "Your ankle keeps giving way? Here are 3 reasons why" | Injury Decoded |
| 2 | "After your ACL tear they told you to wait 6 months? That's dangerous advice" | Injury Decoded |
| 3 | "Your shoulder clicks when you raise your arm? Show this video to your doctor" | Injury Decoded |
| 4 | "3 exercises I give EVERY runner. No exceptions" | Injury Decoded |
| 5 | "Stretching will NOT fix your hamstring. Here's what actually works" | Myth Busting |
| 6 | "This is what I teach physiotherapy students at Frederick University" | Behind the Science |
| 7 | "Myth: you can't run with a bad knee. Reality:" | Myth Busting |
| 8 | "How to know you need a physio — and not just 'wait it out'" | Education |
| 9 | "A day in the life of a sports physio in Cyprus" (voiceover for day-in-life montage) | Personal |

**How to shoot:**
1. Camera at eye level, slightly above (more flattering angle)
2. Antonis standing or sitting on the treatment bed
3. Hand gestures encouraged — this is NOT a lecture, it's a conversation with a friend
4. Repeat the first line (hook) 2-3 times — this is the most important part
5. Look INTO the camera, not next to it
6. Long pauses are fine — we'll cut them in editing
7. Subtitles will be added in post (not needed during filming)
