## 4 Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: "Injury Decoded" (40% of content)
- Short-form video (Reels/TikTok): common sports injuries in 30-60 seconds

  - "Why your ankle sprain keeps coming back"

### Pillar 2: "Case Studies / Transformations" (25% of content)
- Before/after stories (with patient consent)
- Athlete return-to-sport journeys
- Format: Narrative arc — injury → treatment → result
- Examples:
  - "This footballer was told he'd be out 8 months. He came back in 4."
  - "From knee surgery to personal best: Maria's marathon story"

### Pillar 3: "Behind the Science" (20% of content)
- University teaching moments → content
- Explaining WHY specific exercises work
- Examples:
  - "I teach this to physiotherapy students at Frederick University. Now I'm sharing it with you."
  - "The science behind why your physio makes you do THIS exercise"

### Pillar 4: "Personal / Human" (15% of content)
