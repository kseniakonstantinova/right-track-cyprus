# Brand Positioning — "The Athlete's Physio"

**Date:** February 12, 2026

---

## Brand Promise (One Sentence)
> "Antonis Petri gets athletes back to competition — faster, stronger, and with the science to prove it."

## Why This Positioning

| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| **Defensible** | University Clinical Supervisor + sports team partnerships = credentials competitors can't copy |
| **Specific** | Not "physiotherapy for everyone" — sports & athletic rehabilitation |
| **Aspirational** | Even non-athletes want to be treated like athletes (halo effect) |
| **Content-rich** | Sports injuries = visual, dramatic, shareable before/after stories |
| **Premium-justifiable** | Sports physio commands higher perceived value |

## Brand Architecture
- **Primary Brand:** Antonis Petri (personal brand = trust vehicle)
- **Secondary Brand:** Right Track Physiotherapy (the clinic entity)
- **Hierarchy:** Antonis IS Right Track. The clinic is his platform, not the other way around.

## Brand Voice
- **Tone:** Confident expert who simplifies complex science
- **Language:** "Here's what's actually happening in your knee" > "We provide evidence-based treatment modalities"
- **Personality:** The physio who explains what other physios don't bother explaining
- **NOT:** Academic jargon. Not overly casual. Not salesy.

## Target Audience (Priority Order)
1. **Primary:** Athletes (amateur and professional) with sports injuries
2. **Secondary:** Active people (gym-goers, runners) with pain/injuries
3. **Tertiary:** General population needing physiotherapy (GESY patients)
4. **Future:** Kids/developmental, elderly homecare

## Differentiation vs Competitors

| Competitor says | We say |
|----------------|--------|
| "Evidence-based physiotherapy" | "I get athletes back to competition" |
| "Professional treatment" | "This is what I teach to physiotherapy students at Frederick University" |
| "Experienced team" | "We work with Lakatamia FC, PAEEK Kyrenia, and competitive fighters" |
| "Modern clinic" | "Our gym + clinic means your rehab goes all the way to performance" |
