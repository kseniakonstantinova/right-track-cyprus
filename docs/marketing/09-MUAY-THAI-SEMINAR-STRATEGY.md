# Muay Thai Warriors Seminar — Strategic Analysis & Execution Plan

**Date:** February 13, 2026

## Context

Muay Thai Warriors approached Right Track to offer a seminar to their fighters, proposing ~€20/ticket. GPT provided an initial proposal. This document analyzes that proposal through our GTM strategy lens and outlines the execution plan.

## PART 1: STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

### DIAGNOSIS: GPT delivered a solid B-. Good tactics, missed the strategy.

GPT treats this seminar as an **isolated event**. Through our GTM lens, this is actually **one of the most powerful activation levers available right now** — because it sits at the intersection of 4 existing assets:

1. **Muay Thai Warriors** is already listed as a partnership in the GTM plan
2. **"The Athlete's Physio"** positioning is PERFECTLY aligned with fighters
3. **Content drought** (zero video content) — this event solves it
4. **Lead generation** — 20-30 warm bodies in one room who trust Antonis after 90 min

---

### WHAT GPT GOT RIGHT

- The seminar is a **lead generator, not a product** — correct framing
- **90-minute duration** — spot on
- **Option A** ("Train Hard. Fight Smart. Stay Injury-Free.") — commercially strong, brand-aligned
- **"Fighter Recovery Package"** upsell concept — smart back-end monetization
- **Collaborative teaser content** with MT Warriors — good cross-pollination
- **Not underselling** — 29€ is better than 20€

---

### WHAT GPT MISSED (critical)

#### 1. Obsessed with ticket price, missed the real ROI

GPT spent 40% of its answer on pricing math (€500 vs €609 vs flat fee). **This is rookie thinking.**

The REAL ROI of this seminar:

| Value source | Estimated value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Content generated** (2-4 weeks of Reels, Stories, carousels) | €300-500 equivalent | |
| **New patients** (5-10 conversions) | €500-1,500 in LTV | 1 session = €40-60, avg patient = 5-8 sessions |
| **Google Reviews** (5-10 from attendees) | Priceless at this stage | GTM target: 20+ in 3 months. This event = 25-50% of that target in ONE day |
| **Email/phone list** | Long-term asset | 25-30 warm contacts for future marketing |
| **Partnership deepening** | Ongoing referral channel | MT Warriors coaches → permanent referral source |
| **Brand positioning** | Strategic | "Antonis Petri = The Fighter's Physio" cemented in the community |

**Total strategic value: €2,000-3,500+**

Ticket revenue (€600-870) is barely 30% of total value. GPT optimized the wrong variable.

**Implication:** You could run this seminar for FREE and still come out ahead — if you execute the lead capture and content strategy correctly.

#### 2. Zero data capture strategy

GPT proposal: zero mention of collecting emails, phones, or Instagram handles.

**This is a critical failure.** Without data capture, 70% of attendees walk out and forget you exist within 48 hours.

**Fix:**
- Registration form (Google Form): name, email, phone, Instagram handle, "what's your biggest injury concern?"
- This becomes your warm lead list AND informs future content
- Offer: "Everyone who registers gets a free 'Fighter's Recovery Checklist' PDF after the seminar"

#### 3. No content strategy tied to the event

GPT mentions "3 teaser videos" — that's it. Our GTM plan says: **1 content piece → 7 formats**. This seminar should generate:

**PRE-seminar (2-3 weeks before):**
- 3 Reels: "Top 3 Muay Thai injuries," "Why fighters keep getting hurt," "What I'll cover at the seminar"
- 5+ Stories: countdown, behind-the-scenes prep, polls ("What hurts most after training?")
- 1 blog article: "Injury Prevention for Combat Sports Athletes" → SEO asset
- 1 LinkedIn post from Antonis
- 2 Google Business Posts

**DURING the seminar:**
- Photographer/videographer (even a phone is fine)
- 10-15 Stories (live, raw, authentic)
- 3-5 video clips for future Reels
- Group photo (social proof)
- Candid shots of Antonis teaching (personal brand gold)

**POST-seminar (1-2 weeks after):**
- Recap Reel (highlights)
- Carousel: "5 things fighters learned at our seminar"
- Attendee testimonials in Stories
- Follow-up email to all registered attendees
- Blog recap with photos
- LinkedIn: "Last Saturday I taught 30 Muay Thai fighters how to stay injury-free"

**Total content yield: 15-25 pieces from ONE event.** That's 3-4 weeks of content calendar SOLVED.

#### 4. No Google Reviews strategy

30 people in a room who just received 90 minutes of value from Antonis = the single best opportunity to collect Google Reviews you'll have this quarter.

**Fix:** At the end of the seminar, during Q&A:
- Display QR code to Google Review page on screen
- "If you found this valuable, a Google review helps other athletes find us"
- Follow up via WhatsApp/email within 24 hours with the review link

#### 5. No retargeting infrastructure

Meta Pixel still isn't installed (listed as a critical gap in GTM plan). If you're sending people to the website to book, you CANNOT retarget them without it.

**Fix:** Install Meta Pixel BEFORE the seminar. Period.

#### 6. No post-event follow-up sequence

GPT proposes the "Fighter Recovery Package" but with no mechanism to deliver it.

**Fix — 3-email sequence:**
- Day 1: "Thanks for coming! Here's your Fighter's Recovery Checklist" (PDF)
- Day 3: "Exclusive seminar offer: Initial Assessment + 2 sessions for €89 (valid 2 weeks)"
- Day 7: "Last chance for your seminar-only offer"

### PRICING — MY POSITION

**25€, not 29€.** Here's why:

- 29€ is psychologically "thirty" — it crosses a mental barrier for a gym audience
- 25€ is a clean number, still feels like "twenty-something"
- Your REAL monetization is the back-end (physio sessions), not the ticket
- Lower barrier = more attendees = more content = more leads = more reviews

**Revenue split:** Not 70/30. Propose: **Right Track keeps all ticket revenue, MT Warriors provides the venue + promotion for free.** Frame it as: "We bring the expertise and content, you bring the community. Your members get value, we both win." If they push back, offer 20% (~€150) as a hosting fee.

### Full monetization stack:

| Layer | Revenue | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Tickets (25-30 ppl × 25€) | €625-750 | Day of event |
| "Fighter Recovery Package" (5-8 ppl × 89€) | €445-712 | Within 2 weeks |
| Long-term patients (3-5 ppl) | €600-1,500 | Over 3 months |
| Content value (3-4 weeks solved) | €300-500 equiv. | Immediate |
| Google Reviews (5-10) | Strategic value | Within 1 week |
| **TOTAL** | **€2,000-3,500+** | |

---

### STOP LIST

- DO NOT negotiate around ticket price as the main topic — it's 30% of the value
- DO NOT run the seminar without a registration form — you'll lose 70% of leads
- DO NOT skip content BEFORE/DURING/AFTER — that's the main asset
- DO NOT do it in English only — the audience is likely Greek-speaking
- DO NOT launch without Meta Pixel on the site
