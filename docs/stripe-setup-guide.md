# Stripe Payment Setup Guide — Right Track Physiotherapy

## Can a Sole Proprietor Physiotherapist Use Stripe in Cyprus?

**Yes.** Stripe in Cyprus supports **sole proprietors (ατομική επιχείρηση)** — no need to register a Limited company.

Per the [Stripe Services Agreement — Cyprus](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa/cy):

> "Only businesses (**including sole proprietors**) and non-profit organisations located in Cyprus are eligible to apply for a Stripe Account and use the Services."

## Is Physiotherapy a Restricted Business on Stripe?

**No.** According to [Stripe's Prohibited and Restricted Businesses list](https://stripe.com/en-th/legal/restricted-businesses), physiotherapy is **not** in the prohibited or restricted categories. Restrictions apply to telemedicine, online pharmacies, and prescription drugs — but not to in-person therapeutic services.

## What You Need to Connect Stripe

1. Be registered as a **sole trader** (ατομική επιχείρηση) in Cyprus
2. Provide identity documents (passport/ID), proof of address, and a Cypriot bank account
3. Select business type **"Individual / Sole Proprietor"** during Stripe onboarding

## Sole Trader Registration in Cyprus

Registration is done through the **Cyprus Companies Registrar** and takes approximately **4 business days**:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Approve business name with the Companies Registrar |
| 2 | Register with the Trade Register (via a lawyer) |
| 3 | Register with the **Tax Department** — obtain a TIC (Tax Identification Code) |
| 4 | Register with **Social Insurance** (contributions: 16.6% — 12.6% social insurance + 4% GESY) |
| 5 | If annual revenue exceeds €15,600 — register as a **VAT payer** |
| 6 | Open a business bank account |

For a physiotherapist, you will additionally need a **diploma and registration with the relevant professional association** (likely already in place if practising under GESY).

## Tax Obligations for a Sole Trader

| Tax | Rate / Details |
|-----|---------------|
| **Income tax** | Progressive scale 0–35% (first €19,500 tax-free) |
| **Social insurance** | 16.6% of income (paid quarterly) |
| **VAT** | 19% if turnover >€15,600 — however, **medical services in Cyprus are generally VAT-exempt** |
| **Advance tax payments** | Twice per year |

## Stripe Fees in Cyprus

| Card Origin | Fee |
|-------------|-----|
| European cards | 1.5% + €0.25 per transaction |
| Non-EU cards | 2.5% + €0.25 per transaction |

## Conclusion

No company (Ltd) is required — registering as a **sole trader** is sufficient. If Antonis is already registered as self-employed under GESY, Stripe can be connected directly with no restrictions for physiotherapy services.
